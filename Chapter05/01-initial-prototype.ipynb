      "Now, to classify the day_type:\n",

      "- Exercise minutes are up (+16.2%), but not extremely high (43 vs 37 avg).\n",

      "\n",
      "- 'training': if high activity, but steps are low, exercise minutes are only 43, which is not very high.\n",

      "\n",
      "But the trend over previous 7 days is down, meaning it was decreasing, but today it's high. The baseline is the average of previous 7 days excluding today, so if the trend is down, it means in the last 7 days, body battery end was decreasing, but today it jumped up.\n",
